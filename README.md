# trump-data-science
A data science project that investigates the tweets of the two presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Word clouds are produced for each, as well as graphs showing the 10 most common words tweeted by them. This project could easily be adapted to analyse other Twitter accounts by obtaining CSV files containing the relevant tweets.
